\section{The Problem}
\label{sec:TP}
It is estimated that by 2020 at least 100 folds network capasity should be increase to meet the oncoming demand. Currenty vendor and operators are implementing different techniques to improve the network capasity. To improve the network capcity, all the tools can be calssified into three categories as show in figure - \ref{fig:NWCP}


In the early days of wireless communication systems, voice service is the most popular service which requires only tens of Kbps per user equipment (UE). However, these days video steaming is the most popular service requiring tens of Mbps per UE. In future, these demands will go up dude to increase in usage of more internet of things (IOT) applications, with rapid advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality, autonomus driving systems and higher resolution multimedia services (example 4k, 8k resolutions) etc., Which require networks capable of handeling more number of UE's and high data transfer rates at higher energy efficiency.
